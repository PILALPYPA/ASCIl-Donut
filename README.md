1. Basic Idea
The project uses 3D graphics mathematics and text rendering (ASCII) to create a rotating donut (torus) in real time. Instead of using graphics libraries, everything is done using symbols from the shades = ".,-~:;=!*#$@" string, where each symbol represents a lighting level.
The video was based on the ASMR program.
